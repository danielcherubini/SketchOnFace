# Icon Resources

Replace the placeholder files with actual PNG icons:

- `16x16.png` - Small toolbar icon (16x16 pixels)
- `32x32.png` - Standard toolbar icon (32x32 pixels)

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icon should convey "wrapping a sketch onto a surface". Ideas:
- A curved line wrapping around a cylinder/oval shape
- A 2D grid transforming onto a 3D curved surface
- The letter "W" stylized as a wave on a surface

## Creating Icons

You can use any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Figma) to create PNG files with transparency.

Fusion 360 will use the 32x32 icon for the toolbar button and 16x16 for smaller UI elements.
